# pc-field-synthesis
Software to compute focused beam transmissions of photonic crystals using angular spectrum field synthesis
This software package accompanies the publication of "Computing focused beam transmissions of photonic crystals using angular spectrum field synthesis" in Optics Express 2025.

# Getting started
This code does not need to be installed and can be run by any python IDE. Clone the repository, preferabbly create a virtual environment and install the required packages.

# Required packages
The code uses folowing python packages:
- numpy
- scipy
- h5py
- matplotlib

# Running the code
The script "create_plotdata.py" can be used to (re)-generate all processed data of the publication. Go to 10.5281/zenodo.14724835 to download the raw data.
The raw data can also provide the structure needed to use this code on your own data set. We strongly recommend the open-source h5-viewer SILX viewer to inspect h5-files!
